# SMS-Spam-Detection
📩 SMS Spam Detection with Bayesian Models + LLM Refinement
🔍 Overview

This project builds a spam detection system using both classical Machine Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Phase 1: Train a Naïve Bayes classifier to detect spam messages.

Phase 2: Integrate an LLM layer (via prompt engineering) to refine classification, reduce false positives, and better handle ambiguous/spam-like text patterns.
